## Features

A lightweight non-opinionated NPM library that offers a custom React hook that utilizes websockets to synchronize state between multiple clients and can evolve state dynamically, coupled with a server side NPM library containing a handler to receive messages from the hook on a websocket server which persists the state updates on a database and notifies clients of changes.

## Installation

1. ``npm install socket-league-client`` for access to the custom React hook.
2. ``npm install socket-league-server`` for access to the websocket server handler.

## How It works


## Demo Apps

- Echo Server
